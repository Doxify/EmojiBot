# EmojiBot
Project was inspired by [Prplz](https://twitter.com/prpl_z) and his [Emojiman Bot](https://github.com/prplz/emojiman).

This bot will get a random emoji from a list and add it to your twitter name, every 30 seconds. 
This is my first python project.

If you are experienced with python and there's something you would do differently please feel free to send me a DM on twitter [@vndrei](https://twitter.com/vndrei)
